      <p><span>In addition to my professional background, I have also been involved in various projects.
         For example, I was a project lead for the Fridge Tracker project in San Diego, CA. I designed 
         and developed an IoT device that attaches to the fridge, maintaining an inventory of food items 
         and providing a convenient user experience. I have also led projects in advanced processor architecture 
         design, American Sign Language (ASL) to English text interpretation, and the development of a
          coffee recipe journal app called Caffeinated. These projects have allowed me to showcase my
           skills in full-stack development, Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Agile management, SystemVerilog,
            GUI, and machine learning. Through these experiences, I have honed my analytical skills and
             developed a deep understanding of various technologies and methodologies.</p></span>
      <p><span>Furthermore, I have a strong educational background, having attended UCSD (University of
         California, San Diego), where I acquired knowledge and skills in my field of study. My
          academic training, combined with my practical experience, has provided me with a solid
           foundation to excel in my professional endeavors.</p></span>
      <p><span>Overall, I am a dedicated and versatile professional with a passion for delivering
